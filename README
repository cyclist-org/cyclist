QUICKSTART:
The executables in the tar file have been linked in such a way that they should
work without any non-standard dependencies on an x86_64 Linux system.

The tools are:

fomain.native  : first-order prover.
slmain.native  : separation logic entailment prover.
prmain.native  : program termination prover. 
abdmain.native : inductive precondition abducer
ccmain.native  : separation logic consistency checker for inductive definitions.

Running an executable without arguments will print out instructions for use. 
Running "make all-tests" will run a test suite for the first three provers.
Running "make abd-tests" will run a test suite for the abduction prover.

The theory behind the first three is described in   

  James Brotherston, Nikos Gorogiannis, and Rasmus L. Petersen. 
  A generic cyclic theorem prover, accepted for publication in APLAS, 2012.


COMPILING:
To compile things from scratch you will need to cd into the directory c_cyclist 
and follow the README included there.

In addition, you will need:
ocaml (tested with 3.12.1, with native compilers), menhir, ocamllex, ocamlbuild
and ocaml-melt.  

In non-standard installations you may need to change the paths in the Makefile.

Then, just run "make" and hopefully it should work :)
