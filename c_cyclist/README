COMPILING:
Files here are primarily used to build a static library for all the C++ code,
that the OCaml files in the parent directory can link to.

You need: g++ (tested with 4.7.1), Spot (tested with version 0.9.1) and 
the C headers for your OCaml (for Debian/Ubuntu, get the ocaml-nox package).

Spot is available from:
  http://spot.lip6.fr/wiki/

Run "make". If it doesn't produce an archive called "cyclist.a" read on.

You may need to edit the top part of the Makefile depending on where you 
installed Spot, where your OCaml distribution puts its C header files and where
the static version of the C++ standard library is located (NB to compile for a 
32-bit system you *will* have to change the variable for the C++ std. library).
There are comments in the Makefile to guide you.
