* modularise and clean up parsers; maybe drop menhir and use PCL
* modularise/abstract variables, formulas, definitions for SL
* drop melt as a dependency and re-do the required stuff locally
* consider hash consing for terms formulas etc
* consider patricia trees and maps for most uses
* decide on symheap representation: special data structure or general formula type
