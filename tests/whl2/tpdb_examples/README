The benchmarks in this directory are translations from the Termination Problems
Database (version 10.3):

	http://termination-portal.org/wiki/TPDB
	
The directory structure and filenames mirror that of the database in order that
one may easily determine which examples the benchmarks correspond to.

Some benchmarks are duplicated by others; this is indicated by a filename
without an extension, the contents of which is a relative path to the test that
is being duplicated.
