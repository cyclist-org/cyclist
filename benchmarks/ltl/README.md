# Benchmark Test Cases for the Propositional LTL Prover

## Expected Outcomes

* 01.tst: Theorem
* 02.tst: Non-theorem
* 03.tst: Theorem
* 04.tst: Non-theorem
* 05.tst: Theorem
* 06.tst: Theorem
* 07.tst: Theorem
* 08.tst: Theorem
* 09.tst: Theorem

## Further Notes

* 01.tst: Basic theorem (no modalities)
* 02.tst: Basic non-theorem (no modalities)
* 03.tst: Propositional LTL induction principle
* 04.tst: Basic non-theorem (with modalities)
* 05.tst: LTL trichotomy (strong version)
* 06.tst: LTL dichotomy (nesting depth 2)
* 07.tst: LTL trichotomy (weak version)
* 08.tst: LTL dichotomy (nesting depth 1)
* 09.tst: A variation of 05.tst, that Eddie Jones found "by typo".
